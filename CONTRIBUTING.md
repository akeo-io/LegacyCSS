Before creating a pull request or an issue, please read the following rules.

- If your issue is a question or sugggestion, please use [SUGGESTION] or [QUESTION] in the title.
- DO NOT create a pull request with changes to the design of Legacy, if you have a suggestion, create an issue with a demo image/mockup of the design change you'd like to see. If I agree that the idea is good, feel free to make a Pull Request. (A near perfect example can be found here: https://github.com/joexn/LegacyFramework/issues/46)
