Legacy 4


Hello and welcome to Legacy 4!
There have been some big UI and back-end changes so let's go through them..

1) Themes!
  Yes, themes are a thing in Legacy. Functionality is basic at the minute but in future Legacy will be more customisable than ever.
  So, the legacy-core.sass file is the main core of Legacy, it contains all the code which makes Legacy, Legacy..
  legacy.sass is where you can define colours, fonts, widths, borders and more.
  Compile legacy-core.sass to a .CSS file and your ready to go. Loving your theme? Send it to me at (hi@joexn.com) and I'll feature it on the website.

2) Templates!
  Legacy is stable enough to start making themes.
  If you've made a theme, email it me me (hi@joexn.com) - I'll check it out and host it on the templates page!

3) UI Improvements
  Legacy has been redesigned to be more cleaner and nicer looking.
  The buttons now have a small drop shadow on hover and there are some new classes,
  including ".card"

4) Version changes and development
  There has been some big changes in my life since Legacy 3, I have now officially left school so no more exams, which also means
  more time to develop Legacy and some other projects ;)
  I also have brought a Macbook so when I travel, I can develop on them too, instead of having to wait to be back at my desktop.

  Now that I have more free time, a lot more updates coming to Legacy.. So we need to talk about naming versions and what not.
  But not now... Enjoy Legacy!!
