Legacy was made as a minimalistic approach to modern web design. Legacy 3 incoroprates everything that makes the web beautiful.
The colour scheme is from Google's Material Design, and the styles are flat and modern.

```

Legacy/
├── GettingStarted.html
├── legacy.css
├── legacy.min.css
└── legacy.sass

```

#### How to install, compress and minify.

I use atom.io <br />
Atom is a great editor for SASS, CSS, PHP and more. I use extensions which automatically compile SASS file and then automatically minifies them.
<br /><br />
If you prefer a more traditional method, use the instructions below.

> Install SASS using if you haven't already:

>     gem install sass

> (Depending on your setup, this may or may not require `sudo`.)

> To compile the SASS source code to CSS, use:

>     sass legacy.sass legacy.css

> To compile the SASS source to a minified file, use:

>     sass -t compressed legacy.sass legacy.min.css
