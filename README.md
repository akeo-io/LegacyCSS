### Time for a refresh

As many of you know, Legacy's development hasn't been the best. The framework is currently unstable and not ready for production use.
<br /><br />
Legacy 4.0 is being worked on, but it will take a couple of weeks. It will only be released when it has been tested and is **Fully Stable**.

<br /><br />
Check the 'dev' branch for the development version.
