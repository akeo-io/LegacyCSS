# Legacy Framework 4.0
### modern design, lightweight framework

<br /><br /><br />
#### What's in the download?

If you want to download Legacy, you don't get the dev kit (SASS files/compilers)
<br />
If you'd like to get all of this, download the repo zip instead.

```

Legacy/
├── Hello.html
├── LICENSE
├── legacy.min.css
└── legacy.css

```

<br /><br /><br />
#### How to install, compress and minify.

I use [Atom](https://atom.io) to code SASS, then a ```.command``` file to automatically compile and minify the files for me. <br /><br />
 Prefer a more traditional method? Use the instructions below.

Install SASS using if you haven't already:

    gem install sass

(Depending on your setup, this may or may not require `sudo`.)

To compile the SASS source code to CSS, use:

    sass legacy-core.sass legacy.css

To compile the SASS source to a minified file, use:

    sass -t compressed legacy.sass legacy.min.css


<br /><br /><br />
#### Want us to host it?
To use Legacy on your site without downloading it, include this code in your <head> tags:

```
<link href="https://cdn.joexn.io/legacy.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
