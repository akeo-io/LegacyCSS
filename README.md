# LegacyCSS 5.0
**The development of LegacyCSS has been temporarily stopped due to personal reasons. Legacy will be back.**

Modern, Lightweight CSS Framework.

Legacy is a CSS framework that is super simple. It is a starting point, not a fully developed framework.


### Getting started

Visit the [downloads](https://legacycss.com/download) and download the latest version then extract it to your websites root (don't overwrite your index.html if you already have one!) and begin.

### What's in the download?

All that is included is an index.html file, legacy.css, legacy.min.css and legacy.sass.



### Want us to host it?

```html
<link href="https://legacycss.com/dist/legacy.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
